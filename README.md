# Hakos Baelz – DROWN

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Descend again
To the place
Alone
Enough's enough
Never wanted this
Please no more words
No more suffering
And blundering
Silence is all I need
Today…
Time be still…
Switching off the lights
Welcome in the abyss
Sinking in despair
But numb to the pain
Covering my ears
The more the noise
Starts to hurt
I finally chose
To drown
In depths I find
its easier
to breathe
Spiraling down
How'd it come to this?
Life's endless maze
Endless struggling
No escaping
Locked away all my fears
Within
All is still
Reach into the dark
Come (here), lie in the abyss
Contract signed and sealed
One cannot be free
Opening my eyes
Overflowing tears
Oh they taste so sweet
It's easier just
To drown
Let me fade away
Hope is long gone
No such miracles
To save us all
Only way out I know
Is here…
Drown with me
Silencing all sound
Welcome to my abyss
Nowhere else to go
A prisoner of fate
"Someday you will stand"
But those words are
empty and void
All lies
They told me to go
And drown
So let's fade away
Let all disappear
Leaving behind
Nothing (Spoken)
